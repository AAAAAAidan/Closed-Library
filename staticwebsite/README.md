# Simple Library Static Website

## AD - SBA - HTML/CSS/JavaScript

My website files for the website SBA. The files are to be hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AAAAAAidan/Simple-Library/tree/master/staticwebsite). Most of this code will eventually be merged with the rest of my case study files. Currently, the site can be thought of as a demo for what this case study site, as a digital book library, will look like. index.html contains a small gallery of book covers and their titles, search.html contains a search bar with selectable filters, and signup.html contains a signup form.
